## Acknowledgements

These notes are based on [The Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms Bundle](https://codewithmosh.com/p/data-structures-algorithms) by Mosh Hamedani. If you're interested in learning data structures and algorithms, I highly recommend checking out the course.

Please note: this repository is not intended as a standalone learning resource, but rather as a quick reference for key concepts.

## Disclaimer

Not all solutions are perfect as this is my own take on the exercises!
