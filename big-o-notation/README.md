# Big-O theory

## `O(1)`, or constant time complexity

`O(1)` means that the execution time (or number of operations) of an algorithm does not depend on the size of the input.

```java
int getFirstElement(int[] arr) {
    return arr[0];
}
```

**Key Idea:**

- Fastest possible time complexity
- Performance stays the same, whether input is 10 items or 10 million
- Efficient
- Doesn't grow with input size

## `O(n)`, or linear time complexity

`O(n)` means that the execution time grows directly in proportion to the input size.

```java
int sum(int[] arr) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        total += num;
    }
    return total;
}
```

**Key Idea:**

- Performance scales with input size
- Efficient for many tasks
- Slower than O(1) for large inputs

## `O(n^2)`, or quadratic time complexity

`O(n^2)` means the algorithmâ€™s runtime grows proportionally to the square of the input size. This usually happens when there are nested loops over the input.

```java
void printAllPairs(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
            System.out.println(arr[i] + ", " + arr[j]);
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Idea:**

- Two nested loops over the same input
- Time grows very quickly with input size
- Can get slow fast
- Usually avoided for large inputs

## `O(log n)`, or logarithmic time complexity

`O(log n)` means the algorithm's execution time grows slowly as the input size increases. Instead of checking every element, it cuts the problem in half each time.

```java
int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
        else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

```

**Key Idea:**

- Problem size is halved at each step
- Super efficient for large datasets (when applicable)
- Very fast
- Applicable for sorted or structured input

## `O(n log n)`, or linearithmic time complexity

`O(n log n)` means the algorithm does logarithmic work (`log n`) for each of the `n` elements

```java
// Most efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort run in O(n log n)

void mergeSort(int[] arr) {
    // recursively splits the array in half (log n)
    // and merges n elements back together at each level
}
```

**Key Idea:**

- The problem is divided recursively `(log n)`
- All elements are touched (`n`) during processing and merging
- More complex than `O(n)`, but much faster than `O(n^2)`
